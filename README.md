## CPB Fee Calculation

#### What this does

Calculates the total fees for a user's fills over a given time period.

#### How To Use

1. Go to Coinbase Pro's website and generate a report for your fills for a given range. Be sure to select "CSV" as the type. You will receive an email with this information called "fills.csv". Put that in this directory after cloning it.

2. Run `python3 calc.py`

3. Profit ?? (hopefully)
